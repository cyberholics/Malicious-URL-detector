<h2 id="topic1"> 1. About the project</h2> 

Malicious URLs are web links created to achieve dubious acts like scams, frauds, or phishing. Some malicious URLs are designed to install malware on user devices when clicked on. The interesting thing about these URLs is that they are designed to appear like a normal safe URL, therefore luring naive users to click on them. 
Conventional approaches to combating these threats have depended on the use of blacklists and whitelists, which consist of URL listings classified as malicious or safe. Nevertheless, blacklists have limitations in terms of their applicability and their inability to safeguard against novel, unidentified malicious URLs. In this project, machine learning techniques will be applied to address this challenge.
